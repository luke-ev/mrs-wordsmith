# Luke Evangelidis - Mrs WordSmith Technical Test

1. Memoizer
- Located in `memoizer.ts`
- Not a working solution, apologies, I had a hard time with the TS generics and how to set them correctly to input and return the same values in this case 

2. Number Conversion
- Exported from `number.ts`
- Can be run locally with `npx ts-node src/numbers.ts` or by running `npm run test` from `number.test.ts`

3. Simple account management API
- Run `npm run dev` to spin up local server
- API endpoints can be tested by importing `endpoints.json` to Postman
- All data is updated using `fs` rather than an external database
